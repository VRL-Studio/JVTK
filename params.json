{"name":"JVTK","body":"JVTK\r\n====\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](./JVTK/resources/screenshot01.jpg \"Screenshot\")\r\n\r\nSwing based [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) Panel (supports transparency and fullscreen mode).\r\n\r\n## Why this project?\r\n\r\nThe Java binding of VTK only provides heavyweight AWT based UI components. This has been done due to performance\r\nissues when accessing the native render data from Java. In some cases however, it is necessary to use real Swing components\r\n(lightweight). This allows for component layers (components can be rendered on top of the VTK component),\r\ntransparency and many other features.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the performance issue with custom color and sample model which allow for direct image conversion.\r\nThis is relatively efficient. In addition to that a fullscreen mode has been implemented to gain full render performance.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n- VTK 5.10\r\n- Java 1.6\r\n- Netbeans 7.1 (optional)\r\n\r\n## Compile\r\n\r\n- Build VTK with the following options:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON\r\nBUILD_TESTING=OFF\r\nVTK_WRAP_JAVA=ON\r\nCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Copy the content of `$VTKBUILD/bin` to `JVTK/natives` (`$VTKBUILD` is the location of the VTK build folder)\r\n\r\n- Open the `JVTK` project with NetBeans and compile (necessary preferences are already defined)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n- Open the `JVTK` project with NetBeans and run it.\r\n- Press the `Increase Alpha` and `Decrease Alpha` buttons to change transparency\r\n- Double-Click to enter fullscreen mode\r\n- Double-Click again or press `ESC` to leave fullscreen mode\r\n\r\n> **NOTE**\r\n> In fullscreen mode rendering is done with maximum performance as native rendering is used.","tagline":"Swing based VTK Panel (supports transparency and fullscreen mode)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
